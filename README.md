`url and domain hunting`<br>
`bash dorker for dorking URL's`<br>
`see if a domain has been blacklisted`<br>
`usage of proxies to return server GET/POST/DELETE Requests`<br>
`usage of NASM-64 Bit architec Assembly for hardware nad software specifications`<br>
`more usage of perl within string conversions and hexidecimal formatting`<br>

You may be wondering, why so much go? <br>

well to be honest yes this project is going to still be based off ruby mainly as the mains cript however im switching it more to perl, go, and rust since all three of these languagves deal really well with handeling, parsing, and conversions of stringed URL's, ontop of that but the go-lang is alot mroe easier for meto write in and has alot more functionality to it, as well as speed 
<br>
# when will V 4.0 come out?
honestly probobly before december, as i am trying as hard as i can to impliment go-diver, and a few other tools written from go that i have made as well as URL parsers, i want to take alot of time with this project and make it worth my time and energy, this one im sure will certianly blow peoples mind, if the last version didnt already
